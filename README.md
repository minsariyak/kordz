A prototype of a music streaming application showcasing my UX design skills.

This project was done as part of one of my University courses, "Designing User Interfaces" over the course of 4 months.
In this project a music streaming mobile app's interface is redesigned going through all the stages of the user interface design process. 
1. Existing interfaces were analyzed and the problem domain was explored. 
2. A low-fidelity prototype was developed and presented to users.
3. After considering user feedback and making necessary amendments, a high-fidelity prototype was developed.
4. A usuability testing script was made, interview questions were formed, and a consent form was written to conduct a usuability test with the instructor of the course through a zoom meeting.
5. Data gathered was analyzed and the user interface was modified.
